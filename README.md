VstoAddinInstaller
===================

[InnoSetup][] script to install and activate Visual Studio Tools for
Office&reg; (VSTO) addins. VstoAddinInstaller makes heavy use of the
InnoSetup Preprocessor (ISPP).

Features
--------

- Installs Word&reg;, Excel&reg;, PowerPoint&reg;, or Outlook&reg;
  add-ins.
- Downloads and installs .NET and VSTO runtimes if needed.
- Checks if the target application is currently running and can
  automatically shut it down before proceeding with the installation
  process.
- Can be used with an `/UPDATE` switch to silently shut down and
  restart the target application after the installation.
- Modular structure makes it easy to keep custom configuration
  separate from the core functionality.

The script is based on the installer used by [Daniel's XL Toolbox][].


Requirements
------------

- [InnoSetup][] with InnoSetup Preprocessor; ideally you would obtain
  the InnoSetup QuickStart Pack.
- [InnoSetup Download Plugin][isdp] (takes care of downloading the
  .NET and VSTO runtime installers on the target system, if needed)
- Visual Studio with Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) (included
  in the 'Professional' editions).

Some of these requirements should be fairly obvious...


Instructions for use
--------------------

VstoAddinInstaller is designed to keep itself out of your way: After
downloading and extracting the [archive][zip] (or cloning the [Git][]
repository), you should have a dedicated folder 'VstoAddinInstaller'
in your solution directory. You won't have to edit anything inside the
VstoAddinInstaller directory. A configuration file can be copied from
an example file `make-installer.dist.iss` from the `config-dist`
subdirectory to your solution's directory, where you may want to
include it in your own version control system.

A recommended folder structure is as follows:

        YourSolutionFolder
        ├── deploy                  <-- custom folder, name it whatever you like
        │   ├── make-installer.iss  <-- your custom config file for VstoAddinInstaller
        │   ├── VstoAddinInstaller  <-- VstoAddinInstaller, e.g. as Git submodule
        │   │   ├── config-dist
        │   │   │   ├── make-installer.dist.iss  <-- template for your make-installer.iss
        │   │   │   └── ...
        │   │   └── ...
        │   ├── setup-files         <-- additional files, such as a license file
        │   │   └── ...
        │   └── releases            <-- where the installer will be written to
        │       └── ...
        ├── YourProject
        │   ├── bin
        │   │   ├── Debug
        │   │   │   ├── YourProject.vsto   <-- generated by Visual Studio
        │   │   │   └── ...
        │   │   └── Release
        │   │       ├── YourProject.vsto   <-- generated by Visual Studio
        │   │       └── ...
        │   ├── YourProject.csproj
        │   └── ...
        ├── VERSION.TXT             <-- text file containing the version number (optional)
        └── ...


### Cloning as Git submodule

If you use [Git][] as your version control, you can clone the
VstoAddinInstaller respository into a submodule of your project
repository:

    git submodule add git@github.com:bovender/VstoAddinInstaller.git

You can then easily update the VstoAddinInstaller module by *changing
into the directory* and issuing

    git pull

Because the entire VstoAddinInstaller repository is contained in the
submodule, you can switch between branches and use the `develop`
branch rather than the `master` branch if you wish to do so.


### Configuring

You need to make a copy of `config-dist\make-installer.dist.iss` and
edit the contents. Ideally you would keep your copy of this file
outside the `VstoAddinInstaller` directory, as shown above, so it does
not get overwritten when you update VstoAddinInstaller.

You can rename the file to `make-installer.iss` or whatever you wish;
the `.dist` part in the original file only serves to indicate that
this is the distributed example file.

Follow along the instructions in your copy of
`make-installer.dist.iss`.

**Important**: Each installer produced with InnoSetup must have its
own global unique identifier (GUID). Please insert your own GUID where
indicated. You can generate a GUID using the corresponding command
from the `Tools` menu in InnoSetup Studio, for example.


### Compiling the installer

To compile the installer, simply run your copy of `make-installer.iss`
through InnoSetup.


### Extending

If you wish to add additional capabilities to your installer (e.g.
InnoSetup tasks), have a look in the `config-dist` directory where you
will find some example files.

Currently it is not possible to run additonal code during
initialization of setup (`InitializeSetup`) or initialization of the
wizard (`InitializeWizard`). I have been thinking about how to provide
this capability, but have not yet have the time to implement it.


Demos
-----

Demo projects are contained in the [demo](demo/) directory.

In order to try out these demo installers, you must first build the
corresponding projects in Visual Studio. The binaries are not contained
in this repository!

Versioning
----------

VstoAddinInstaller is [semantically versioned][semver] using Git tags.

In short: The version number follows the scheme `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- An increase in the `MAJOR` version number signifies API-breaking
  changes, i.e., if you decide to upgrade, you *must* adjust your local
  copy of `make-install.iss`.
- An increase in the `MINOR` version number denotes new or improved
  features. You can upgrade without adjusting your `make-install.iss`.
- The `PATCH` number is increased with bug fixes. Again, no need to edit
  your copy of `make-install.iss`.

 
Contributing
------------

You are welcome to submit pull requests for this project. I like to 
follow [Vincent Drieessen's Git branching model][nvie] where development 
takes place on the `develop` branch, and the `master` branch always 
points to the latest stable release.

Therefore, I would like to ask you to issue your pull request against 
the `develop` branch.
