; *** DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, WORK ON A COPY! ***
; Changes may be lost if the file is updated from the Git repository.
; Make a copy of the file in the parent directory and name it
; 'make-installer.iss'. You may want to version your file.
; Then, insert the information relevant to your addin.
; This file pulls in other files from a 'VstoAddinInstaller'
; subdirectory, so you should not rename this subdirectory.
; Run this file through the InnoSetup compiler to produce the installer
; executable.

; == DEBUG MODE

; Uncomment the line below to enable debug mode.
; #define DEBUG


; =====================================================================
; == VERSION INFORMATION

; The script will read the version information from a text file by
; default; the text file must contain two lines:
;   1. The semantic version (e.g. 2.1.8-beta.3)
;   2. The four-number Windows file version (e.g., 2.1.8.3)
; Uncomment the line below to define VERSIONFILE, which will make the
; script read the version information from a text file.
; Note: No sanity check is performed; you must make sure the file does
; contain the two lines with the appropriate information.
; #define VERSIONFILE "VERSION.TXT"

; Alternatively, you can indicate the version number directly in this
; script. The version numbers below are overwritten if VERSIONFILE is
; set.

; The version number. It is suggested to use the semantic versionin
; scheme (http://semver.org), but this is not a must. This version
; information may contain text.
#define SEMANTIC_VERSION "1.0"

; The version in four-number format
#define FOUR_NUMBER_VERSION "1.0.0.0"

; The year(s) of publication (e.g., "2014-2017")
#define PUB_YEARS "2017"


; =====================================================================
; == STATIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE ADD-IN

; Target application. This is used internally by the script
; in order to determine the appropriate registry keys etc.,
; and must be one of 'excel' or 'word'.
#define TARGET_HOST "excel"

; Specific AppID
; Use InnoSetup's Generate UID command from the Tools menu
; to generate a unique ID. Make sure to have this ID start
; with TWO curly brackets.
; *Never* change this UID after the addin has been deployed,
; lest the users of your add-in will have multiple entries
; in their software list (Add/Remove Software).
#define APP_GUID "{{...your UID here...}"
#define ADDIN_NAME "Name of your add-in"

; The ADDIN_SHORT_NAME is used to generate the installer file
; name and may also be used as a suggestion for installation
; directory during system-wide installations. If it is not defined,
; the value of ADDIN_NAME is used instead. Do not use characters
; that are illegal in file names.
#define ADDIN_SHORT_NAME "Short name without special characters"

#define COMPANY "Your company name"
#define DESCRIPTION "Describe your add-in in one short sentence."
#define HOMEPAGE "http://www.example.com"
#define HOMEPAGE_SUPPORT "http://optional.example.com"

; SOURCEDIR is the directory that contains the files that
; need to be installed; e.g. 'MyProject\bin\Release\'.
; Include a trailing slash!
#define SOURCEDIR "MyProject\bin\Release\"

; VSTOFILE is the file that needs to be written to the registry in
; order to activate the add-in.

; == ADDITIONAL FILES NEEDED DURING COMPILATION

; SETUPFILESDIR is the directory that contains additional
; files needed to create the installer.
; The files below are all expected to be in this directory.
; The SETUPFILESDIR *must* ende with a backslash, unless it is empty.
#define SETUPFILESDIR "setup-files\"

; Adjust the paths below for your specific set-up and uncomment the lines.
; #define DEVENV "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.com"
